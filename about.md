I like to chill. As you can see in the picture above, I am very skilled at chillin. I like to chill to the extend of being hungry for challenges. Intellectual, engaging challenges. 
Currently I am in the process of turning my career around. Long time ago(long is relative) I studied tourism and hotel management in a cold city located in the northern hemisphere. After that I worked for few years in different parts of the world. But there have always been something deep inside that was telling me I haven't found my calling. The jobs I worked at were not resonating with me, I wasn't feeling intellectually engaged. Long story short, one day I decided no matter what I am going to do my best to change my career, and even if there is a need I will get a new degree. I have no idea where I got that much determination. But I remember clearly, this phrase had been echoing in my head all along: "it is better to try and then regret than to reget without ever trying". After overcoming many hurdles and burocratic barriers, I managed to arrive to Toronto after which a new chapter of my life, which I am currently in, started. Not gonna lie it has been a crazy ride so far. I would dare to stay the most difficult thing I have done in my life so far is my attempt to get a degree in CS at the University of Toronto. 

I finished 3rd year of school already. As I write this I am doing PEY(Professional Experience Year) at IBM as a backened engineer. 

I like talking to people, making new friends, reading, learning, working out, travelling etc.
