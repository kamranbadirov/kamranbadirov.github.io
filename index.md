# Kamran Badirov: Computer Scientist & Dragon Boat Enthusiast

Kamran Badirov is a passionate professional deeply engrossed in the realms of software systems and low-level computer concepts. A proud alumnus of the University of Toronto, he earned his degree in Computer Science in June 2023. His enthusiasm for the subject extends into the classroom, where he has imparted his knowledge as a Teaching Assistant for Database courses. Presently, he's guiding the bright minds of UofT through CSC409 Scalable Computing and CSC373, focusing on Algorithm Design, Analysis, and Complexity.

Having worked at industry stalwarts like IBM, Kamran's cumulative experience of 22 months across various tech companies has honed his technical acumen and problem-solving capabilities. But his pursuits are not limited to software and algorithms. A formidable member of the UCBD dragon boat club, Kamran clinched a gold medal in 2023 and a bronze in 2022 at the Canadian Dragon Boat Championship, representing open boat university teams.

Outside of professional and competitive domains, Kamran is a lifelong learner and embraces new challenges. He's gearing up to make strides at the TCS Toronto Waterfront Marathon. While he has been acquainting himself with the chords of a guitar for the past three years, Kamran jokingly admits to mastering just three songs. Nevertheless, his journey exemplifies a blend of technical expertise, athletic prowess, and an ever-curious spirit.
